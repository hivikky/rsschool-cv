I am passionate about learning, setting goals and its achieving. Coding and programming are absolutely new things to me,

I would like to develop.

I've got superficial knowledge of JavaScript. 

**5. Code examples (LATEST)**
none

**6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)**

Intro to IT from LeverX, free online tutorials from GeekBrains
Apart from IT education I had graduated from two universities: BSU (department of chemistry), BSMU (department of pharmacy)
