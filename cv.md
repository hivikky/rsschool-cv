I am passionate about learning, setting goals and its achieving. Coding and programming are absolutely new things to me, 
just another Universe, so i am diving into this new world. Also I see how useful these skills can be. Moreover I have a few ideas about some applications 
I would like to develop.

**6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)**
